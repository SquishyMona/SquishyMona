Hey, I'm Ian. I like computers and stuff.

I'm currently working on my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm proficient in Python and TypeScript, with knowledge also in C++, C#, and HTML/CSS.

I work a lot on web development primarily using React and Next.JS, but also have some interest in mobile development with .NET MAUI and Swift.
