Hey, I'm Squishy. I like computers and stuff.

I'm currently working on my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm proficient in Python and C#, with knowledge also in C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Swift.

Some technologies I have experience in include .NET MAUI, React, Next.JS, Pycord (Discord API Wrapper for Python), and Firebase
